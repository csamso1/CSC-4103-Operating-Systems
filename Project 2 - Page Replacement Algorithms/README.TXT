Readme for Project 2
Arthur: Clayton Samson

This java program is named PageReplacementAlgorithms.java and is first compiled by: javac PageReplacementAlgorithms.java

To execute the program you must run it by: java PageReplacementAlgorithms arg[0] arg[1] arg[3]

The program takes the suggest input arguments as noted below:

arg[0] = 'StringForAlgorithm'
arg[1] = int for cache size
arg[2] = 'StringForFileName'

Example execute instruction: java PageReplacementAlgorithms CLOCK 20 pageref.txt

the program accepts the following strings as inputs for the algorithm:

'LRU' or 'CLOCK'

The program outputs the following information:

System Cache Size: X for input confirmation
Algorithm to use: clock or lru for input confirmation
Total Time Elapsed = X Time Units
Total Cache Miss Time = X Time Units
Total Cache Write Back Time (Dirty Page) = X Time Units
Total # of page references = X
Total # of page misses = X
